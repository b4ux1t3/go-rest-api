#REST in Go

This is a simple project that I'm using to further my basic understanding of Go with regard to workflows, tooling, and packaging.

Right now, the only thing this program can do is handle requests for a "/collatz/" directory and spit out a compiled template with the results of whatever is passed into the path after `/collatz/`. I know there's a specific term for that, but I'm an idiot who doesn't do his research.
